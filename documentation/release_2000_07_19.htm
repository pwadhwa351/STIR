    <h1>Summary of changes in PARAPET release 0.91 (dated 19/07/2000)</h1>

<h2>General changes:</h2>

<ul>
<li> added conversion to ecat6 and handle ecat7
<li> software is now tested on Linux (on Pentium) with gcc 2.95.2 (this only needed some changes to PPhead/Makefile_common)
<li> Interfile parser follows now the 3.3 standard, and some of the proposed extensions there-in on vectored keys (Note: this is the parser only, NOT the keywords).
<li> corrected some problems with Makefiles
<li> added the extract_segments utility
</ul>

<h2>OSEM related changes:</h2>

<ul>
<li> corrected a bug that caused problems with parsing .par files (for instance, the interiteration filtering setting was ignored on some architectures)
<li> thresholding after filter operations (to obtain positive image values) is changed to make it insensitive to spurious peaks in the image
</ul>

<h2>Other:</h2>

<ul>
<li> fixed a bug that made the truncate_end_planes in manip_image do nothing.
<li>  the Absolute Difference operation in manip_image (MATH MODE option
2) is now applied to all voxels.
<li> compare_image uses a slightly higher threshold now
<li> made utilities/do_linear_regression compile
<li> added PPhead/test/input/test_linear_regression.in to the archives. (Needed for make run_tests)
</ul>
